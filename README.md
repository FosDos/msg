Problem 2)
Create an abstract class called Book. Include a String field for the book&#39;s title and a double
field for the book&#39;s price. Within the class, include a constructor that requires the book title
and two get methods: one that returns the title and one that returns the price. Also include an
abstract method named setPrice(). Create two child classes of
Book: Fiction and NonFiction. Create a list containing multiple instances of each type of
book and store all the books in a single array.
Create an application (terminal or GUI) that allows the following functions to be performed
interactively:
 List all books in the list
 List all fiction titles
 List all non-fiction titles
 Allow multiple books to be selected from the list and present the user with a total cost
